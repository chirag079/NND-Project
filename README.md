#Overview
This project is a full-stack decentralized platform that integrates two major components:

**Carbon Credit Staking DApp** – A blockchain-based platform where users can stake carbon credits (represented as ERC20 tokens) and earn reward tokens based on their contribution.

**Blockchain Chat DApp** – A real-time decentralized chat system built on top of blockchain, allowing transparent and tamper-proof communication among users.

✨ Key Features
1) Stake carbon credit tokens to earn rewards

2) Transparent and immutable smart contracts

3) Dynamic pool parameters for flexible staking

4) Integrated chat app using Web3 and smart contract messaging

5) Built with Solidity, React.js, Ethers.js, and Hardhat

6) Encourages sustainability through real-world impact
